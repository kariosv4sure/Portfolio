👋 About Me

I’m a PFJ Stack Developer focused on building backend-driven web applications using Python, Flask, and JSON. I create practical tools like AI-powered assistants, dashboards, and lightweight platforms backed by clean APIs and simple, responsive frontends.

I care about functionality first, performance, and shipping real products — not just demos.
